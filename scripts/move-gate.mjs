/**
 * ── MOVE GATE: the four tiers that must ALL pass before a cluster may move ─────────────────────────
 *
 * User ruling 2026-11-11. A move is admitted only when every tier says YES; any NO stops the move and
 * the reason is reported. The point of putting this in a script is that "I checked it" is not a result:
 * each tier prints the MEASUREMENT it was decided from, so a reader can disagree with the verdict.
 *
 *   A  模块大小   module size ≤ 800 lines (declaration span)                       ← TD-1's original meaning
 *   B  依赖总和   closure size — REPORTED ONLY, never a veto                        ← the old misreading
 *   C  可拆分性   four questions, all must be YES (see below)
 *   D  性能不退   efficiency / safety / stability / concurrency, all must hold
 *
 * ── C: THE FOUR QUESTIONS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * C1 一句话说清   can the cluster be described in one sentence WITHOUT "and"?
 * C2 调用面       is it called only by the container and its own cluster? (a test importing it is fine —
 *                 the question is whether PRODUCTION code reaches into it)
 * C3 可独立测试   can ≥3 assertions be written importing ONLY the cluster (never index.ts)?
 * C4 无隐式时序   does correctness depend on "must run inside the container, after variable X is set"?
 *                 C4 is the decisive one: a sub-block that reads state produced by an earlier loop is
 *                 not functional, no matter how small its closure.
 *
 * This script MEASURES C1–C4 as far as a machine can, and prints what a human must still confirm. It is
 * deliberately honest about that split: `machine` verdicts are computed, `review` verdicts are printed
 * as OPEN and must be filled by a human reading the code. A gate that pretends to decide a semantic
 * question by regex would be the same failure this whole phase keeps finding.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/move-gate.mjs --cluster GraftConfig
 *   node scripts/move-gate.mjs --cluster GraftConfig --json

 * ── SPANS COME FROM THE COMPILER, NOT FROM A SECOND PARSER ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Six wrong answers in one afternoon, all from a hand-written scanner trying to do what the TypeScript
 * compiler already does:
 *
 *   1. counting only `{}` — `export function buildTape(` opens its brace nine lines later, so the
 *      function measured 0 lines and tier C4 reported "0 local assignments" (a false PASS)
 *   2. per-line block-comment stripping — `export const inject` swallowed to L767, GraftConfig vanished
 *   3. a character state machine that cannot tell a REGEX LITERAL from a comment — L990's
 *      `/(for the rest …` ate the rest of the file, losing tokenSet / nearDuplicate / normalizedEqual
 *   4. object-literal keys and property accesses counted as variable reads
 *   5. a bracket counter that could not handle template-literal `${` nesting — `buildInjectionPlan`
 *      measured **4,002 lines against the compiler's 744**, swallowing 3,258 lines of unrelated
 *      declarations (including `noteForcedCut`, which then disappeared from every downstream count and
 *      made the span sum disagree with the closure by 25 lines)
 *   6. treating a multi-line signature as a closed body
 *
 * The lesson is not "write a better regex". It is: **a second parser is a second truth**, and two truths
 * drift. `closure.mjs --declarations` now emits the compiler's own span table, and this file consumes it.
 * The calibration (six known spans, plus "span sum == closure lines") lives in test/v138-move-gate.test.mjs.
